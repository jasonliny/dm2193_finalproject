        <div class="whole">
          <ul>
            <li>"Platforms" are attempting to rid themselves of any responsibility over content posted by users.</li>
            <li>However, once these platforms reach such a large scale, the impact of harmful content is substantially more significant.</li>
            <li>A lack of moderation benefits their revenue streams, especially for advertisers.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/">Harmful content has been shown to have higher engagement</a>, which is what advertisers want.</li>
            <li>Platforms are also hypocritial, as they already <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/01/facebook-disinformation-report/">selectively exercise their role as a publisher</a>.</li>
