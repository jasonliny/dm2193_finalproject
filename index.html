    <div class="intro" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-once="false">
      <p>The distinction between a service being a platform or publiser has major legal implications, mostly related to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
      It determines whether or not one can be held responsible for hosting certain content. Before Section 230, similar laws were present for physical goods, a common example being stores that sell physical materials such as books.
      These establishements were considered distributers and were not held strictly liable for all the content they sold,
      and this is what many online services today (most notably social media companies) want to be labeled as.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>"Platforms" are attempting to rid themselves of any responsibility over content posted by users.</li>

            <hr>
            <li>Get rid of algorithmic feeds.</li>
            <li>Stop promoting engaging content, which incentivizes harmful content and contributes to the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">"filter bubbles"</a></li>
